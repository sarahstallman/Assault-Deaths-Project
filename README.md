# Effects of Age and Gender on Assault Death Rates in Pima County vs Maricopa County

In this data science project, we aim to analyze mortality data from Pima County and Maricopa County to investigate whether factors like age and gender influence susceptibility to assault-related deaths. We also seek to determine which of these two counties has a higher assault death rate. By focusing on these counties, which encompass the University of Arizona and the city of Phoenix, respectively, we aim to gain insights into the safety of our community and assess potential demographic trends in two of Arizona's most populous regions.
